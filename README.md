# Bee Gees: Rock Band
![header](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89483283-f999-4d76-9967-4f58ebb03fd1)

This repository is a collection of my songs for the Bee Gees: Rock Band project.
Each song will have full-band and full difficulties and will be tailored for use in RB4. (Will be converted to previous titles although they aren't the focus.)
